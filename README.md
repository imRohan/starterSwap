# Starter Swap
A simple rails application that lets users trade starter cultures for bread making. This was made to learn the rails workflow.
## Getting Started

1. Install Rails at the command prompt if you haven't yet:

        gem install rails

2. Change directory to `starterSwap` and start the web server:

        cd starterSwap
        rails server

   Run with `--help` or `-h` for options.

3. Using a browser, go to `http://localhost:3000` and you'll see the app
